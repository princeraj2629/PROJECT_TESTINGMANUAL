Hello Sir, My name is Prince Raj, I am Masai School ft36_2008. Below is some points regarding my Project of Construct Week.

I am extremely glad that you gave me that opportunity to this hands on project of Manual Testing. I was so excited to work on this project when it was announced . I hope that
you will like my work and will give me more opportunities in future to do so. 
                             In this I have shown the proper working of the module which has been given to me. I have done almost everypart of it which is possible by creating its particular Test Cases,Bug Reports,Test Plan also i have shown in those test cases that how it has been passed.
